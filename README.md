# Effect of noncompliance on COVID-19 disease control

Code for running simulations and plotting results from "Model-based evaluation of the impact of noncompliance with public health measures on COVID-19 disease control" by Stoddard M et al. Preprint can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240440v1).

The code is provided as an IPython notebook that requires numpy, matplotlib, pylab, and scipy to run. Both the notebook file and a static HTML version with the plots displayed are provided here.
